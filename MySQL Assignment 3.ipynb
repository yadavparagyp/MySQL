    "Q1 ] Create a function and then call another function from within it. What is this process called?\n",
    "  \n",
    "  The process of calling a function from within another function is commonly known as \"function invocation\" or \"function calling\". It's a fundamental aspect of procedural and functional programming paradigms. When a function is invoked within another function, the control flow transfers to the called function, executes its code, and then returns to the caller once the called function completes its execution.\n",

    "# Call the outer function to initiate the process\n",
    "outer_function()\n",
    "```\n",

    "Q2 ] How to inspect the query's execution plan?\n",
    "\n",
    " Inspecting a query's execution plan is a critical task for database administrators and developers to understand how the database engine processes the query and retrieves data. The method to inspect the execution plan depends on the database management system (DBMS) you're using. Here are general steps for some common database systems:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Microsoft SQL Server:**\n",
    "\n",
    "In SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Open a New Query window.\n",
    "2. Write your query.\n",
    "3. Before executing the query, click on the \"Include Actual Execution Plan\" button in the toolbar, or press `Ctrl + M`.\n",
    "4. Execute your query (`F5` or clicking \"Execute\" button).\n",
    "5. View the execution plan in a separate tab below the query results.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **MySQL:**\n",
    "\n",
    "MySQL provides the `EXPLAIN` statement to inspect the execution plan:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "EXPLAIN your_query_here;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Execute this statement before your actual query to see the execution plan.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **PostgreSQL:**\n",
    "\n",
    "PostgreSQL provides the `EXPLAIN` statement as well:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "EXPLAIN your_query_here;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Oracle Database:**\n",
    "\n",
    "In Oracle, you can use the `EXPLAIN PLAN` statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "EXPLAIN PLAN FOR your_query_here;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Afterward, you can query the plan from the `PLAN_TABLE`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT * FROM PLAN_TABLE;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **SQLite:**\n",
    "\n",
    "SQLite supports the `EXPLAIN` keyword:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN your_query_here;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. **DB2:**\n",
    "\n",
    "DB2 also provides the `EXPLAIN` statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "EXPLAIN PLAN FOR your_query_here;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. **MariaDB:**\n",
    "\n",
    "MariaDB, being MySQL-compatible, also supports the `EXPLAIN` statement similar to MySQL:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "EXPLAIN your_query_here;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. **Amazon Redshift:**\n",

    "Q 3] What is the purpose of the MAXDOP and recompiling keywords in SQL queries?\n",
    "\n",
    "    In SQL Server, MAXDOP (Maximum Degree of Parallelism) and the RECOMPILE query hint serve different purposes in optimizing query performance:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. MAXDOP (Maximum Degree of Parallelism):\n",
    "\n",
    "MAXDOP controls the maximum number of processors that SQL Server can use to execute a single statement in a parallel plan. It limits the degree of parallelism for a single query execution. By default, SQL Server uses all available processors to parallelize query execution unless MAXDOP is explicitly configured.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Purpose of MAXDOP:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Performance Optimization:** Setting MAXDOP appropriately can optimize query performance by preventing excessive parallelism, which might lead to resource contention and overhead.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Resource Management:** It helps in managing server resources by limiting the number of processors a single query can use, preventing one query from monopolizing all available resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Stability:** Controlling parallelism can prevent performance degradation or contention issues, especially on systems with high concurrency.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. RECOMPILE Query Hint:\n",
    "\n",
    "The RECOMPILE query hint tells SQL Server to discard the existing execution plan and generate a new one each time the query is executed. It can be applied at the statement level using the OPTION (RECOMPILE) query hint.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Purpose of RECOMPILE:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Parameterized Queries:** RECOMPILE is useful when the query is parameterized and the optimal plan can vary based on the parameter values. It allows SQL Server to generate a plan tailored to the specific parameter values provided at runtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Plan Stability:** Ensures that the execution plan is optimized for the current query parameters, data distribution, and statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Avoiding Plan Caching Issues:** It helps avoid plan caching issues where a single execution plan might not be optimal for all possible parameter values.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Dynamic Query Optimization:** Useful for dynamically generated SQL queries or queries with dynamic search conditions where the optimal plan can change based on runtime parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, MAXDOP controls the degree of parallelism for query execution to optimize resource usage, while RECOMPILE ensures that the query plan is optimized for the specific parameters and conditions at runtime. Both features contribute to improved query performance and resource management in SQL Server environments.\n"

    "Q 4] How to build DDL statements from an existing database table, write steps for it?\n",
    "\n",
    "   To build Data Definition Language (DDL) statements from an existing database table, you typically need to extract the structure and properties of the table. DDL statements define the structure, constraints, and other attributes of database objects like tables, indexes, and constraints. Here are the general steps to build DDL statements from an existing database table:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Identify the Database Management System (DBMS):\n",
    "\n",
    "Know which database management system (DBMS) you are working with, as syntax for DDL statements may vary between different systems (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, Oracle).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Connect to the Database:\n",
    "\n",
    "Use a database client tool or command-line interface to connect to the database where the table resides.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Retrieve Table Information:\n",
    "\n",
    "You need to extract the necessary information about the table structure, constraints, indexes, and other attributes. This can be done through various means:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Database GUI Tools:** Use tools like SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS), MySQL Workbench, pgAdmin, or Oracle SQL Developer to visually inspect the table structure and properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **System Catalog Views/Metadata Queries:** Execute metadata queries specific to your database system to retrieve information about the table. For example:\n",
    "  - In SQL Server: Use system views like `sys.tables`, `sys.columns`, `sys.indexes`, etc.\n",
    "  - In MySQL: Utilize `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` tables.\n",
    "  - In PostgreSQL: Query `information_schema.tables`, `information_schema.columns`, etc.\n",
    "  - In Oracle: Query `ALL_TABLES`, `ALL_TAB_COLUMNS`, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Generate DDL Statements:\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the information retrieved, manually construct DDL statements to recreate the table's structure and properties. The DDL statements typically include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **CREATE TABLE:** Defines the table structure, column names, data types, constraints, and other attributes.\n",
    "- **ALTER TABLE:** Includes statements to add or modify columns, constraints, or indexes.\n",
    "- **DROP TABLE:** Optionally, include a statement to drop the existing table if you intend to recreate it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Verify and Test:\n",
    "\n",
    "Review the generated DDL statements for accuracy and completeness. Ensure that all necessary attributes, constraints, and indexes are included. Execute the DDL statements in a test environment to verify that they recreate the table as intended.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Document:\n",
    "\n",
    "Document the generated DDL statements for future reference and version control. This documentation aids in understanding the table structure and can be useful for database schema management and migrations.\n",
    "\n",

    "Q 5] How to update data in a table using an inner join, write an example?\n",
    "\n",
    "    Updating data in a table using an inner join involves joining the table to be updated with another table based on a specified condition and then modifying the data in the target table according to the matched rows. Here's an example using SQL syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say we have two tables: `employees` and `salaries`. We want to update the salary of employees whose IDs match in both tables.\n",

    "SET employees.salary = salaries.new_salary\n",
    "WHERE employees.department = 'Engineering';\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation of the SQL Update Statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `UPDATE employees`: Specifies the table to be updated.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `INNER JOIN salaries ON employees.employee_id = salaries.employee_id`: Performs an inner join between the `employees` table and the `salaries` table based on the `employee_id` column, matching rows where the employee IDs are equal.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `SET employees.salary = salaries.new_salary`: Specifies the column to be updated (`employees.salary`) and the value to update it with (`salaries.new_salary`).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. `WHERE employees.department = 'Engineering'`: Optionally, you can include a WHERE clause to filter the rows that will be updated. In this example, we update only the employees in the 'Engineering' department.\n",
    "\n",
    "This SQL statement updates the `salary` column in the `employees` table with the `new_salary` values from the `salaries` table for employees whose IDs match in both tables and belong to the 'Engineering' department.\n",

    "Q 6]  Differentiate between truncate, delete, and drop with a suitable example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Truncate, delete, and drop are SQL commands used for data manipulation and table management, but they serve different purposes and have different effects:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Truncate:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Purpose:** Truncate is used to remove all rows from a table quickly and efficiently. It deallocates the data pages used by the table, but the table structure, indexes, and constraints remain intact.\n",
    "- **Example:**\n",
    "  \n",
    "  ```sql\n",
    "  TRUNCATE TABLE my_table;\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  \n",
    "  This command removes all rows from the `my_table` table, but it retains the table structure and associated metadata.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Delete:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Purpose:** Delete is used to remove specific rows from a table based on a condition or all rows if no condition is specified. It removes data row by row and can be rolled back using a transaction if needed.\n",
    "- **Example:**\n",
    "  \n",
    "  ```sql\n",
    "  DELETE FROM my_table WHERE condition;\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  \n",
    "  This command deletes rows from the `my_table` table that match the specified condition. If no condition is provided, it removes all rows from the table.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Drop:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Purpose:** Drop is used to remove an entire table, including its structure, data, indexes, and constraints, from the database. It effectively deletes the table from the database schema.\n",
    "- **Example:**\n",
    "  \n",
    "  ```sql\n",
    "  DROP TABLE my_table;\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  \n",
    "  This command removes the `my_table` table from the database schema along with all associated data, indexes, and constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Differentiating Truncate, Delete, and Drop:\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider a scenario where we want to remove some data from a table named `employees`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If we only want to remove specific rows of employees who have left the company, we can use `DELETE`:\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```sql\n",
    "  DELETE FROM employees WHERE employment_status = 'Left';\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  \n",
    "- If we want to completely remove all employees' records, including the table structure, indexes, and constraints, we would use `DROP`:\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```sql\n",
    "  DROP TABLE employees;\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- If we want to remove all employee records from the `employees` table but keep the table structure intact, we would use `TRUNCATE`:\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```sql\n",
    "  TRUNCATE TABLE employees;\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, `DELETE` selectively removes rows from a table, `TRUNCATE` removes all rows while preserving the table structure, and `DROP` completely removes the table from the database schema. Choose the appropriate command based on the requirements and desired outcome for data manipulation and table management."
